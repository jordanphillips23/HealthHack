              &emsp; &emsp; Once it's safe for society to re-open, monitoring and controlling crowd sizes will be imperative for mitigating the threat of a COVID-19  resurgence. CrowdCount addresses this need by providing a platform that allows everyone to quickly and easily see how crowded a particular location is. CrowdCount is applicable to a wide variety of organizations, including private businesses (stores, restaurants, etc…), public buildings (libraries, courthouses, DMV, congressional offices, etc…), and educational facilities (schools, colleges, etc…). CrowdCount will ensure that public spaces stay as safe as possible for everyone while allowing consumers to make informed, data-driven decisions in order to protect their own health.

            <hr>
            <p>
              &emsp; &emsp; Our team developed CrowdCount over the course of 9 days, including frontend development with HTML/CSS, backend development with Django, SQLite databases, and our own custom API, and open-source computer vision software using OpenCV. Even though our team members were spread out across the continental U.S., we used collaborative tools such as GitHub and Slack in order to effectively communicate and produce a polished, working product.

            <h2><b>Future Plans</b></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
              &emsp; &emsp; Though we're extremely proud of the work we've done, we understand that CrowdCount, in its current state, is only the beginning of adjusting to life post-COVID-19. For the future, we hope to make our website more interactive and include robust visualizations of our data in order to provide even more to the public. Additionally, we hope to create a weekly reporting system that we can provide to businesses so that they can track changes in their crowd size over time and plan for days of the week that are busier on average. <br>

                &emsp; &emsp; Additionally, we hope to begin integrating CrowdCount into our own daily lives. One important area of us students’ lives that we feel that CrowdCount can specifically impact is university buildings — if universities can carefully monitor the number of people in a lecture hall or library, they will be more confident in their ability to protect students from COVID-19 and can accelerate the timeline of students returning to campus and receiving a high-quality education.
