### 1. Inspiration  



### 2. What it does
CrowdCount is a brand-new project created for the COVID Hackathon II hosted by the Stevens 
Venture Center. This site utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision to track the number of people
entering and exiting an establishment and updates a database in real-time, allowing business 
owners to get a live feed of how busy their location is. Not only would this enable earlier 
re-opening for businesses, but it would also create an environment that is safe for owners,
workers, and patrons alike. Additionally, CrowdCount offers an easy-to-use, search-based 
website that allows members of the public to see both real-time and daily average data for
crowd sizes at establishments of their choice. 

### 3. How we built it  
Our team developed CrowdCount over the course of 9 days, including frontend development with HTML/CSS, 
backend development with Django, SQLite databases, and our own custom API, and open-source computer vision 
software using OpenCV. Even though our team members were spread out across the continental U.S., we used collaborative 
tools such as GitHub and Slack in order to effectively communicate and produce a polished, working product.

### 4. Challenges we ran into  
It goes without saying that the situation the world is in has created a very unique project development experience for everyone.
Since our team members were all in different time zones, finding ways to collaborate in real-time was a big challenge. In regards
to technical challenges, the greatest difficulty was just the fact that we were working with new tools. This meant a lot of time
was spent correcting our own mistakes because we were unfamiliar with syntax or style. In particular, creating a fully functioning
search bar that accessed and searched through a database was a big technical hurdle we overcame. 

### 5. Accomplishments we're proud of  


### 6. What we've learned
Going into this project, we wanted to challenge ourselves to learn to work with new tools we haven't had much exposure
to. Our team members have varying levels of technical proficiency, so each member learned different skills through creating
CrowdCount. Through this project, one member learned the fundamentals of front-end web design (i.e. using HTML, CSS, and Javascript), 
another got to familiarize himself with computer vision concepts, and someone even got to learn simple things such as how
to work with GitHub.


### 7. What's next for this project 
Though we're extremely proud of the work we've done, we understand that CrowdCount, in its current state, is only the 
beginning of adjusting to life post-COVID-19. For the future, we hope to make our website more interactive and include 
robust visualizations of our data in order to provide even more to the public. Additionally, we hope to create a weekly 
reporting system that we can provide to businesses so that they can track changes in their crowd size over time and plan 
for days of the week that are busier on average. 

Additionally, we hope to begin integrating CrowdCount into our daily lives. One important area of us students’ lives that 
we feel that CrowdCount can specifically impact is university buildings — if universities can carefully monitor the number 
of people in a lecture hall or library, they will be more confident in their ability to protect students from COVID-19 and 
can accelerate the timeline of students returning to campus and receiving a high-quality education.
